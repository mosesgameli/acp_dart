## 0.6.0

Completes the method inventory: every method in the published ACP schema is
now implemented. Verified by diffing `agentMethods`/`clientMethods` against
the generated schema constants — 28 agent methods, 14 client methods, and the
protocol cancellation notification, with no gaps.

These surfaces are newer than the stable v1 set and several are still at RFD
stage, so their shapes may change. Pin a version if you depend on them.

### Added

- **Providers:** `providers/list`, `providers/set`, `providers/disable`, with
  `ProviderInfo`, `ProviderCurrentConfig`, and `ProvidersCapabilities`.
  `LlmProtocol` is an open string union in the schema, so it maps to a String
  typedef with known values on `LlmProtocols` rather than an enum — an
  unrecognised protocol has to round-trip, not throw. `SetProviderRequest`
  overrides `toString` to redact `headers`, which carries credentials.
- **Document sync:** `document/didOpen`, `didChange`, `didClose`, `didSave`,
  and `didFocus`, plus `Position`, `Range`,
  `TextDocumentContentChangeEvent`, and `TextDocumentSyncKind`. A null range
  on a content change means a full-document replacement.
- **MCP over ACP:** `mcp/connect`, `mcp/message`, `mcp/disconnect`, and the
  `acp` variant of the McpServer union. `mcp/message` is unusual twice over:
  it sits on both method tables so it is wired in both directions, and it
  arrives as either a request or a notification depending on whether the
  tunnelled MCP message carries an id. Its reply is `Object?` rather than a
  typed model — it is the MCP server's own result, and reshaping it would
  corrupt the tunnel.
- **Next Edit Suggestions:** `nes/start`, `nes/suggest`, `nes/accept`,
  `nes/reject`, `nes/close`. Suggestions are a union over edit, jump, rename,
  and searchAndReplace with an `UnknownNesSuggestion` fallback. Includes the
  context types (recent files, related snippets, edit history, user actions,
  open files, diagnostics) and the capability trees on both sides:
  `NesCapabilities` for what context an agent accepts,
  `ClientNesCapabilities` for what suggestion kinds a client can act on.
  Also adds `WorkspaceFolder`.

### Fixed

- **Capability negotiation:** `ProvidersCapabilities`, `NesCapabilities`, and
  `ClientNesCapabilities` existed as types but were never attached to
  `AgentCapabilities` or `ClientCapabilities`, so the provider and NES methods
  were dispatched yet undiscoverable — no peer could learn they were
  supported. Adds `auth`/`providers`/`nes`/`positionEncoding` to
  `AgentCapabilities`, `session`/`plan`/`auth`/`nes`/`positionEncodings` to
  `ClientCapabilities`, and `delete`/`close`/`additionalDirectories` to
  `SessionCapabilities`, plus `PositionEncodingKind` and the supporting
  capability types.
- **Boolean session config options:** `SessionConfigOption` was select-only —
  `options` was required and `currentValue` was a `String`, so a
  `type: "boolean"` option could not be represented at all. It is now a union
  over `SelectSessionConfigOption` and `BooleanSessionConfigOption` with an
  `UnknownSessionConfigOption` fallback. An option arriving without a `type`
  is read as select, since agents predating the boolean variant omit the
  field. Adds `SessionConfigOptionCategories` for the known category values.

### Compatibility Notes

- **Breaking — `SessionConfigOption` is now abstract.** Construct
  `SelectSessionConfigOption` instead, and cast before reading `currentValue`
  or `options`, which live on the concrete variants. The `type` argument is
  gone; the converter supplies the discriminator.
- **Breaking — `SetSessionConfigOptionRequest.value` is `Object`** rather than
  `String`, so it can carry a bool. Existing call sites passing a String still
  compile; reading `.value` as a String needs a cast. Prefer the new
  `.select()` and `.boolean()` constructors.
- **Breaking for `implements`:** As in 0.5.0, adding members to the `Agent`
  and `Client` interfaces breaks implementors using `implements`, which
  requires every member to be declared. Every new member carries a `=> null`
  default, so `extends` users are unaffected, and returning `null` yields
  `-32601 Method not found` — the behaviour an agent without these
  capabilities should have anyway.

## 0.5.0

Brings the package in line with the stable ACP v1 method inventory. The
missing methods were identified by diffing `agentMethods`/`clientMethods`
against the published schema's method constants.

### Added

- **Elicitation:** Full support for `elicitation/create` and the
  `elicitation/complete` notification, both agent-to-client. Covers form and
  URL modes, session and request scopes, `ElicitationSchema` with all five
  property schema variants (string, number, integer, boolean, array), titled
  and plain multi-select item constraints, `EnumOption`, `StringFormat`, and
  the accept/decline/cancel response actions. Unrecognised modes, property
  types, and actions round-trip through `Unknown*` variants rather than being
  dropped.
- **Elicitation Capabilities:** `ClientCapabilities.elicitation` so clients can
  advertise which elicitation modes they render.
- **Session Lifecycle:** `session/close` and `session/delete`, with typed
  models, dispatch, unions, and `Agent` interface members.
- **Authentication:** `logout`, completing the authentication surface.
- **Notification Routing:** `AgentNotificationUnion.fromMethod`, which
  dispatches on the JSON-RPC method name. The existing `fromJson` takes only a
  payload and always decodes it as a `SessionNotification`, so it cannot tell
  `session/update` from `elicitation/complete`. `fromJson` is unchanged.

### Changed

- **Support Matrix:** `session/list` is documented as stable rather than
  unstable. The README now enumerates the specific schema methods this package
  does not implement (`providers/*`, `nes/*`, `document/did*`, `mcp/*`)
  instead of describing them in the abstract.

### Deprecated

- **`session/set_model`:** Not present in the ACP schema. Model selection is
  expressed through `session/set_config_option` with a model config category.
  The method, `SetSessionModelRequest`/`Response`, `SessionModelState`,
  `ModelInfo`, and the `ModelId` typedef are all marked `@Deprecated`. Dispatch
  is retained so existing integrations keep working.

### Fixed

- **Example Agent:** `example/agent.dart` declared `implements Agent` but
  omitted `unstableListSessions`, `unstableForkSession`, and
  `unstableResumeSession`, so it had not compiled since those methods were
  introduced — despite the README instructing users to run it. Dart only
  inherits default method bodies through `extends`, never `implements`.
- **README Snippets:** Both usage examples were non-compiling. The agent
  snippet used `protocolVersion: '0.1.0'` (the field is an `int`) along with
  `capabilities:` and `auth:`, neither of which exists. The client snippet
  constructed `RequestPermissionResponse` with a non-existent `optionId:`
  parameter and read `option.id` instead of `option.optionId`.

### Compatibility Notes

- **Breaking for `implements`:** Adding members to the `Agent` and `Client`
  interfaces breaks implementors that use `implements`, which requires every
  member to be declared. The new members carry `=> null` defaults, so classes
  using `extends` are unaffected. Implementors using `implements` must add
  `closeSession`, `deleteSession`, and `logout` (agents) or `createElicitation`
  and `completeElicitation` (clients). Returning `null` from any of them keeps
  the previous behaviour: `-32601 Method not found`.
- **Deprecation:** The `session/set_model` surface will be removed in the next
  major release.

## 0.4.0

### Added

- **Stable Method Support:** Added end-to-end support for `session/set_config_option` with typed request/response models and connection dispatch wiring.
- **Unstable Session Surface:** Added unstable support for `session/list`, `session/fork`, and `session/resume`, including typed schema models, capability models, and client/agent interface wiring.
- **Protocol Cancellation:** Added protocol-level `$/cancel_request` support with typed notifications and connection helpers to cancel pending outbound requests.
- **Schema/Model Coverage:** Expanded schema parity with session config option selector families, session capability objects, additional session update variants, and usage/cost payload models.
- **Typed Unions Expansion:** Extended request/response/notification union coverage to include newly supported session and protocol methods.
- **Maintainer Parity Process:** Added `parity_verification_checklist.md` for release-time parity verification.

### Changed

- **Extension Method Semantics:** `extMethod` and `extNotification` now preserve method names exactly as provided; callers must include protocol extension prefixes (for example, leading `_`) explicitly.
- **Request Error Mapping:** Validation-like failures now map to JSON-RPC `-32602` (`Invalid params`) and unexpected runtime failures map to sanitized `-32603` (`Internal error`) payloads.
- **NDJSON Stream Robustness:** `ndJsonStream` now skips malformed non-empty lines and continues processing valid messages, with optional `onParseError` diagnostics.
- **Documentation Accuracy:** README now uses an explicit stable/unstable/unsupported support matrix instead of broad completeness claims.
- **Release Notes Accuracy:** Corrected prior filesystem wording to avoid implying unsupported non-stable filesystem method families.

### Developer Experience

- **Reproducible Environment:** Added `devenv` configuration (`devenv.nix`, `devenv.yaml`, `devenv.lock`) for consistent local setup and CI-like workflows.
- **Regression Test Coverage:** Expanded ACP dispatch, schema round-trip, union mapping, extension, cancellation, and stream error-path test coverage.

### Compatibility Notes

- **Potentially Breaking:** Extension method name auto-prefixing behavior was removed; integrations relying on implicit `_` rewriting must update call sites.
- **Behavioral Change:** Malformed NDJSON lines no longer fail the stream by default; they are dropped unless handled through `onParseError`.
- **Behavioral Change:** Some failures previously surfaced as generic internal errors now return `Invalid params` when they are parameter/validation related.

## 0.3.0

- **Protocol Parity:** Rebuilt every data model to match the official ACP `schema.json`, including sessions, permissions, plans, content payloads, terminal updates, MCP server descriptors, and `_meta` envelopes; regenerated `schema.g.dart` to keep serialization in lock-step.
- **Client Operations Coverage:** Implemented ACP client request/response models for read/write text-file and terminal workflows, ensuring each request carries the appropriate `sessionId`, path fields, and limits, and aligned WaitForTerminalExit and related responses with nullable exit metadata.
- **Typed RPC Unions:** Introduced sealed Agent/Client request, response, and notification unions with exhaustive handling and constant tables; added comprehensive round-trip tests plus HTTP and SSE example flows that exercise the new types end-to-end.
- **Converters & Utilities:** Harmonized converters for session updates, MCP servers, permission requests, and tool-call content, removing non-spec variants while preserving forward-compatible `Unknown*` fallbacks.
- **Stability Fixes:** Corrected numerous spec mismatches (capability flags, optionality, naming, prompt payloads) and tightened serialization behaviors to prevent regressions.
- **Docs & Testing:** Updated research notes, tracked schema alignment in `schema_alignment_checklist.md`, refreshed examples, and broadened test coverage to guard the new behavior.

## 0.2.0

- **Fix:** Resolved critical bug in NDJSON stream handling (`lib/src/stream.dart`) that caused communication failures due to incorrect UTF-8 and line splitting logic.
- **Fix:** Corrected `InitializeRequest` and `InitializeResponse` to properly handle numeric `protocolVersion` and use `clientCapabilities` key, resolving initialization errors with ACP backends.
- **Feature:** Added unstable `Agent.setSessionModel` method for feature parity with the latest ACP TypeScript SDK.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release of the `acp_dart` package.
- Implements the core functionality of the Agent-Client Protocol (ACP).
